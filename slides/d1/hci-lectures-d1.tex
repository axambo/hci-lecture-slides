\frametitle{What is HCI?}
\begin{quote}
Human-computer interaction is a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them. \cite{Hewett.1992.curricula}
\end{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\item Interaction Design is concerned with the theory, research, and practice of designing user experiences for all manner of technologies, systems, and products.~\cite{Preece.et.al.2015.ic-book}
\item Ergonomics and Human Factors have closely overlapping goals with HCI, being concerned with understanding the interactions among humans and other aspects of a system in order to optimize human well-being and overall system performance.~\cite{Preece.et.al.2015.ic-book}

\frametitle{ACM Classification Keywords}
\begin{quote}
ACM's first classification system for the computing field was published in 1964. Then, in 1982, the ACM published an entirely new system. New versions based on the 1982 system followed, in 1983, 1987, 1991, and 1998. The 2012 scheme utilizes a new poly-hierarchical structure and a more in-depth approach than the 1998 version. It no longer uses the letter-and-number coding of the previous versions. The old scheme has been mapped to the new, and both the 1998 and 2012 terms are available on Citation Pages of all indexed articles in the ACM Digital Library.\\

\frametitle{What is SIGCHI}
ACM SIGCHI is the Special Interest Group  on Human-Computer Interaction.
\begin{quote}
SIGCHI is the premier international society for professionals, academics and students who are interested in human-technology and human-computer interaction (HCI). We provide a forum for the discussion of all aspects of HCI through over 20 sponsored and over 40 in-cooperation conferences, publications (eg. OpenTOC: Table of Contents page), communities, web sites, and other services. We advance education in HCI through workshops and outreach, and we promote informal access to a wide range of individuals and organizations involved in HCI.\\

I also discovered that in the grand scheme of things, there are threelevels of design: standard spec, military spec and artist spec. Most significantly,I learned that the third, artist spec, was the hardest (and mostimportant). If you could nail it, then everything else was easy. Buxton, 1997 ~\cite{Buxton.1997}

\begin{itemize}
{\small
\item CHI stands for the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems.
\item The CHI series of academic conferences is generally considered the most prestigious in the field of human–computer interaction and is one of the top ranked conferences in computer science.
\item CHI has been held annually since 1982 and attracts thousands of international attendees. CHI continues to grow, reaching over 3,300 attendees in 2013 and 3,800 in 2016.
\item Since 1993 the acceptance rate for full papers was consistently below 30 percent. After 1992 the average acceptance rate was around 20 percent. The number of accepted full papers is slowly increasing and reached 157 accepted papers with an acceptance rate of 22 percent in 2008.
\item The Proceedings of CHI can be found on the ACM Digital Library: \url{https://dl.acm.org/}

\frametitle{When Second Wave HCI meets Third Wave Challenges}
\begin{quote}
Abstract: This paper surveys the current status of second generation HCI theory, faced with the 
challenges brought to HCI by the so-called third wave. In the third wave, the use context and application types are broadened, and intermixed, relative to the focus of the second wave on work. Technology spreads from the workplace to our homes and everyday lives and culture. Using these challenges the paper specifically addresses the topics of multiplicity, context, boundaries, experience and participation in order to discuss where second wave theory and conceptions can still be positioned to make a contribution as part of the maturing of our handling of the challenges brought on by the third wave.

\frametitle{The `third wave'}
The `third wave' provides a different lens for understanding alternative computing systems to window-icon-mouse-pointer systems, such as ubiquitous, mobile, collaborative or social computing systems. This paradigm is referred by~\cite{Harrison.et.al.2007.three} as “situated perspectives”, a sum of perspectives that studies HCI interaction as situated in a particular context and which connects to qualitative disciplines such as ethnography or practice-based research.

\frametitle{Third-Wave HCI, Ten Years Later (Bødker, 2015)}
{\small
\begin{itemize}
\item The first wave was cognitive science and human factors. It was model-driven and focused on the human being as a subject to be studied through rigid guidelines, formal methods, and systematic testing. \cite{Bodker.2015.third}
\item The second wave is the move ``from human factors to human actors.'' In the second wave, the focus was on groups working with a collection of applications. Focus on situated action, distributed cognition, context, and proactive methods (e.g. participatory design, prototyping). \cite{Bodker.2015.third}
%Theory focused on work settings and interaction within well-established communities of practice. Situated action, distributed cognition, and activity theory were important sources of theoretical reflection, and concepts like context came into focus in the analysis and design of human-computer interaction. Proactive methods, such as a variety of participatory design workshops, prototyping, and contextual inquiries, were added to the toolbox. 
\item  In the third wave, technology spread from the workplace to our homes and everyday lives and culture. Focus on understanding experience and meaning-making. \cite{Bodker.2015.third}

\frametitle{Being human: HCI in the year 2020}
